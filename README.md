# Satellite Imagery Experiments

Convolutional Neural Network experiments in satellite image segmentation. The models are implemented in Python 3.5 using TensorFlow library.

The initial model is based on this paper: [Multiple Object Extraction from Aerial Imagery with Convolutional Neural Networks](http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/ist/jist/2016/00000060/00000001/art00003). The images and labels used for training are from [Massachusetts road & building dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~vmnih/data/).
